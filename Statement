Project Statement: Hospital Management System (HMS)

Problem Statement

The challenge is to develop a foundational, console-based application that can manage basic patient admission and discharge records. The system must adhere to strict academic constraints, utilizing only core Python features—specifically functions, lists, loops, and conditional statements—to simulate the operations of a simple Hospital Management System (HMS). The primary need is a non-persistent record-keeping tool to demonstrate mastery of fundamental programming logic.

Scope of the Project

The scope of the HMS project is narrow and focused on demonstrating basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update/Delete) operations using procedural programming principles.

Inclusions (What the system does):

Record registration (Name, Ailment, auto-assigned ID).

Full list viewing of currently admitted patients.

Searching and removal of records by Patient ID (Discharge).

Mock billing calculation during discharge.

A stable, loop-based menu interface.

Exclusions (What the system does not do):

Data persistence (no file, database, or network storage).

Advanced features like updating existing records, searching by name, or complex filtering.

Security, user authentication, or multi-user access.

Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Target Users

The primary target users are individuals who interact directly with the console application.

Administrative Staff/Clerks: Personnel responsible for admitting new patients and processing patient discharge paperwork.

Students/Grader: The intended audience for academic review, focusing on verifying the correct implementation of the required fundamental programming constructs.

High-Level Features

The application provides four primary functional features accessible via the main menu:

Patient Registration: Captures necessary intake information (Name, Disease) and assigns a unique next_record_id identifier.

Record View: Presents a clean, tabulated list of all patient records currently held in the in-memory admitted_list.

Discharge & Billing: Allows searching for a patient by ID, calculates a mock service charge based on stay duration, and removes the patient record from the system.

Application Exit: Safely terminates the running console application loop.
